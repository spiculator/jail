     1 	Compiling and installing ---------------------------------------------

	Just untar the package, cd to ./src and edit the makefile and do a 'make'. 
	Now you can choose your architecture from Linux, FreeBSD,
	Solaris and IRIX. then configure the installation directory
	(default /usr/local) and you're ready !.

	Perhaps you need to tune some of the compiler directives, if you are in a
	different platform than these ones supported by Jail. After a while, 
	you will have the jail binary created. Then, issue a 'make install',
	to do this, you have to be root (the default path to 
	install is /usr/local). Now you are ready to play with
	jail.
	

     2	Creating the chrooted environment ------------------------------------

	Now choose where directory will be your chroot environment.
	In my example, I choose /var/chroot for	the chrooted 
	environment. Now become root, and launch the mkjailenv command:

		/usr/local/bin/mkjailenv /var/chroot

	The output should look like this:

                mkjailenv

                Making chrooted environment into /var/chroot
                        Doing preinstall()
                        Doing special_devices()
                        Doing gen_template_password()
                        Doing postinstall()
                Done.

	After that, you will have the basic chrooted environment
        installed under /var/chroot.

     3  Adding software into the chrooted environment ------------------------

        After the chrooted environment has been created, we have to
        add some software inside it. To do this, we will use
        addjailsw. This scripts, if called without -P argument,
        will install a default set of programs into the chrooted
        environment. First of all, were are going to install the
        basic set of programs, an then we will install the less
        command.

        To install the basic set of programs, we will issue the
        following command:

			/usr/local/bin/addjailsw /var/chroot

	The output of the program should look like this:

                creating /var/chroot/tty:c:5:0

                Done.
		
        As you can see in the output there are some temporal files, and also,
        there are some files that are begin overwritten, and other that are not
        allowed to be overwritted. This files are the passwd, group and shadow
        files of the chrooted environment. When the scripts ends, it cleans
        all the temporal directories in the chrooted environment.

        Now, we are going to install the 'awk' program into the chrooted environment.
        We need to call the addjailsw script with the -P argument:

		/usr/local/bin/addjailsw /var/chroot -P awk 

	The output for the script will be something like this:

                addjailsw
                A component of Jail
                http://www.gsyc.inf.uc3m.es/~assman/jail/

                Guessing awk args(0)

                Warning: file /var/chroot/lib/libc.so.6 exists. Overwritting it
                creating /var/chroot//usr/bin/awk
                creating /var/chroot//etc/ld.so.cache

                creating /var/chroot//lib/ld-linux.so.2
                Warning: file /var/chroot/lib/ld-linux.so.2 exists. Overwritting it

                Done.


	Now, you have awk installed into the chroot environment. You should
        use this script to install all the software into the chrooted environment


     4	Adding users into the chrooted environment ---------------------------

	Now, it is time to add some users into the chroot environment.
	First of all we need to have the users created in the system,
	so you can add them by hand, or using adduser. For this
	example, I will create a new user called chroottest with adduser
	To do this:

		/usr/local/bin/jail/addjailuser /var/chroot \
		 /home/chroottest /bin/bash chroottest

	After answer all the questions and set the user password, we are
	ready to add this users to the chrooted environment. This 
	program accepts some parameters:

		1) the first parameter is the full path to the
		   chrooted environment (in my example, is /var/chroot)
	
		2) the full path of the directory under the user will 
		   live. This path will be created under the chrooted
		   environment, and when the user logs into, it will
		   see it as the full path. (e.g, in our example,
		   /home/chroottest is the home directory. addjailuser
		   will create /var/chroot/home/chrootest, and when
		   the user logs into, he will see /home/chroottest.
		   Because it lives under the chrooted environment,
		   he will see a 'virtual' home directory).
		   
		3) The full path to the shell that the user will use.
		   (e.g, I like to use bash, so I use the /bin/bash
		   parameter. NOTE: if you want yo use some other
		   shell (or program) you will need to add it to 
		   the list of the installed programs (see section
		   2 to see how to do that).

		4) The name of the user, in my example, chroottest
		   
		After that, we are ready to launch the program
		(always as root):

		/usr/local/bin/addjailuser \
			/var/chroot/ \
			/home/chroottest \
			/bin/bash 
			chroottest	

	The inverted slashes are to allow us insert carriage returns
	because the line is too long to type it in a single shell
	line. After launch the command, the output should look like
	this:

                addjailuser
                A component of Jail
                http://www.gsyc.inf.uc3m.es/~assman/jail/
                Juan M. Casillas <assman.inf.uc3m.es>

                Adding user pruebas in  chrooted environment /var/chroot
                Done.

		
	That's all. You have the user added into the chrooted
	environment. Now is time to try it:

		su - chroottest

	As you can see, you are in the new created chrooted
	environment, Congratulations !


     5	Troubleshooting ------------------------------------------------------

	Well, there are not troubleshooting section :( Im writting some	
	documentation, and improving the code for jail, mkjailenv,
	addjailsw and addjailuser. Also we have a mailinglist with some of the
	tricks and recipes to have jail working:

	(http://www.gsyc.inf.uc3m.es/~assman/archived/jail/)

	Also, you can generate some log files and send them back to me,
	so I will try to manage them and find an answer for your problems.
	I usually need a log for all the scripts and 
	the output for a login session into a chrooted account. 


     6  Porting, improvements and hacks --------------------------------------

	If you tailor the scripts for your platform, please send me the new 
	mkjailenv, so I can put it into the distribution, also, send me
	patches if you write any of them for jail.
